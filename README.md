# Exercises for Nonlinear System Analysis and Control course
The exercises for my Nonlinear System Analysis and Control course were given in two labs (two students per group). This course is given in English.

Lab 1: Blending control (nonlinear control by nonlinearity compensation)

Lab 2: Robot arm control (stabilization using input/output linearization)
