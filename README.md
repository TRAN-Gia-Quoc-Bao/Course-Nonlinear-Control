# Exercises for Nonlinear System Analysis and Control course
The exercises for my Nonlinear System Analysis and Control course were given in two labs (two students per group). This course is given in English.

The first one is "Blending control" which was finished.

The second one is "Robot arm control" which is still ongoing. The codes and report will come soon.
